## A-Bicycle-is-Two-Unicycles
***Made for the GMTK Game Jam 2021.***

A bicycle is two unicycles (joined together), is a game, (and also an independent clause) where you control a malfunctioning bike, with separate controls for each wheel.

The front wheel is controlled with left, right and up arrow keys, (< > ^) and the back wheel is controlled with A, D and W keys (WASD - but without the S).  R to restart too.

The goal of this 4 levelled game is to reach the end of each level to win! (The red flag on the yellow platform)

#### Post Scriptum
Only contains scripts rather than all related files as at that point in time I haven't used much of github yet.
